\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I am incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to be supervised by Gail Murphy,
and to have her support and encouragement that allowed me to pursue the work in this thesis.
This work would not have been possible without her.

I am grateful to Ed Knorr, who provided thorough feedback as the second reader to this thesis,
and who was also an excellent instructor in the brief period I served as a \entity{TA} for him.

I am also thankful for all of the participants who were involved in the evaluation of the work presented in this thesis
and provided interesting insights into their habits and perspectives as developers.

Lastly, I thank my mother for her unwavering and unconditional emotional and financial support for me and my education.

As I grow older, I increasingly cherish the value of time as a finite resource.
To all of the individuals, both stated above and beyond in my life,
I cannot thank you enough for the time you have generously given me in helping to produce and present the work in this thesis.
