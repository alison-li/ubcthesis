\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be supervised by Gail Murphy,
and for all of her support and encouragement that allowed me to pursue the work in this thesis.
This work would not have been possible without her.

I am thankful to Ed Knorr who generously gave his time to provide thorough feedback as the second reader to this thesis
and for also being an excellent instructor in the brief period I served as a \entity{TA} for him.

I would also like to thank all of the participants who were involved in the evaluation of the work presented in this thesis.

Lastly, I thank my mother for her unwavering emotional and financial support.

As I grow older, I increasingly cherish the value of time as a limited resource.
To all of the individuals, both named above and beyond in my life,
I cannot thank them enough for the time they have given me in helping to produce and present the work in this thesis.
