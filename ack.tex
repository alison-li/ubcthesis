\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I am grateful to have had the opportunity to be supervised by Gail Murphy,
who provided her support for whatever I wanted to pursue.
This work would not have been possible without her.

\FIXME{Mention second reader.}

Words also cannot express how grateful I am to my mother for her
unconditional love and support of my every endeavour.
