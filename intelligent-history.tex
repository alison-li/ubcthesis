\chapter{Intelligent History}
\label{ch:Intelligent-History}

To enable the investigation of our hypothesis, we developed Intelligent History, a prototype plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.
We describe the design and features of Intelligent History in \autoref{sec:Design} and elaborate on the implementation
for suggesting potentially more meaningful comments in \autoref{sec:Heuristics}.
In \autoref{sec:Predictions}, we discuss the use cases we envision Intelligent History to be able to effectively support.

\label{sec:Design}

As part of an effort to reduce the cognitive and temporal costs of software history exploration, we chose to develop a plugin to augment the existing rich features an \entity{IDE} already provides.
Unlike a stand-alone desktop or web application, a plugin would minimize the number of external windows a developer needs to maintain an explore to gain context around revisions since the information Intelligent History offers would be integrated within the \entity{IDE}.
The IntelliJ \entity{IDE} provides a built-in Git client \entity{GUI} for navigating a software project's revision history and navigating revisions.

We designed Intelligent History to support the following questions a developer might ask when searching for code rationale information in a file's revision history:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``Which commits are likely to be meaningful for understanding the decisions and choices involved in the evolution of this file?''
    \item ``Is there an interesting discussion that motivated an interesting commit?''
\end{enumerate}

Intelligent History has the following features:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}
