In this chapter, we discuss the implications of our findings and the threats to validity of our work.

Although we formulated a fixed set of patterns specific to Java, \dots \FIXME{Consider moving this to a section on suggestions for future work? Comment on potential for user-defined patterns.}

Making the analysis of important comments more sensitive to task and context.

\section{Threats to Validity}

There are a number of aspects of this user study that impact the validity of our results.
Firstly, since the participants were observed throughout the study by the interviewer, the participants' behaviour, opinions, and feedback about the Intelligent History plugin are subject to the Hawthorne effect.
We attempted to mitigate bias in how a participant expects to use Intelligent History and the applicability of Intelligent History to any particular question set 
by alternating the order of the questions each participant received and 
fixing the use of the plugin to the second question set that each participant receives.

The experience of the participants with regard to experience in working in a project that uses an issue tracking system (\entity{ITS}) and closely associating issues to commits impacts internal validity.
We tried to mitigate the impact of participant experience on internal validity by formulating questions that would require participants to justify their answers using source code and Jira issue information to
encourage participants to view Jira issues.

The limited participant size of 10 participants and the controlled experiment setting of the user study affects external validity.
