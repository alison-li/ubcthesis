\chapter{Lay Summary}

This thesis investigates how identifying non-important and important 
revisions in a software system's revision history can help 
software developers to better answer questions about the motivation behind code.
Developers also may use issues, which are peripheral artifacts tied to revisions, 
as a source of code rationale information.
We introduce a plugin that consists of two approaches to address this.
First, the approach uses the lines of code changes in a revision
to determine if the revision solely contains code changes that the developer
might consider as non-essential.
Second, the approach attempts to reduce context switching between an \entity{IDE}
and an application for viewing issue information, providing the developer with
better access to an issue along with other metrics about the issue.
To evaluate the plugin, we deployed a user study consisting of an
observational study and a semi-structured interview.
We collected data from a total of 10 software developers.
